# SPI
- *spi* project is the first project I worked on and it is a SystemVerilog version of Nandland's
- *cross_domain_clock* is a demonstration of CDC without SPI. async_i is the signal that is syncrhonised.
- *spi_alt* is the next project--incomplete--at building a state machine variant
- *spi_sync* is the latest and greatest. The spi_alt isn't actually complete.
