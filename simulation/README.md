# SPI
- *spi* project is the first project I worked on and it is a SystemVerilog version of Nandland's
- *cross_domain_clock* is a demonstration of CDC without SPI. async_i is the signal that is syncrhonised.
- *spi_alt* is the next project--incomplete--at building a state machine variant
- *spi_sync* isn't quite correct. This is combinational state driven.
- *spi_sync2* This is correct either.
- *spi_sync3* This correctly implements Mode 0 for single byte - full duplex
- *spi_sync4* This...
